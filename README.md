# freejack
A free blackjack game by Jim Weimer and Aleksandar Krbanjevic


This is the branch we used to do most of the development. There is a file in here named "social media project personal". Just ignore this one, I was having issues with changing the name in Git and I finally created another folder to work in. It still has my first set of commits from the first few weeks, but I then started working in the different folder after that. 

TODO:

There are many core functions that we need to implement. The article https://medium.com/@echohatch1/making-a-simple-blackjack-game-with-html-and-javascript-5124123762ce does a good job of outlining what needs to be implemented for a standard JS game. Using this article for inspiration, we came up with the following:

-A Deck object with the functions createDeck and shuffleDeck (IMPLEMENTED).
-valueOfCards function (to find the value of the cards in hand) (IMPLEMENTED)
-postBet function (for the user to make their bet).
-draw function (for the dealer).
-endGame.
-newGame.
