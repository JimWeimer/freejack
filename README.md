A free blackjack game by Jim Weimer and Aleksandar Krbanjevic


This is the branch we used to do most of the development. There is a file in here named "social media project personal". Just ignore this one, I was having issues with changing the name in Git and I finally created another folder to work in. It still has my first set of commits from the first few weeks, but I then started working in the different folder after that.
